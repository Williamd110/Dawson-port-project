            <p>
                I have been swinging a golf club since I was three years old. That passion has always been present in my life and is one of my best ways to spend free time.

                I also enjoy playing a different variety of video games. They are a great way to experience new stories, as well as a way to bond with old friends that may live too far to meet up often.
