# dawson-portfolio
This portfolio is a WIP website project. It will continue to populate with content and polish as I continue my education in working with development.
The first section is the home page which will give a description on who I am as a professional.
The About me section will provide some information on me as a person.
The portfolio page is a reference to my finished material as well as some work in process projects.
